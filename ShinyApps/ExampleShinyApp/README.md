## ExampleShinyApp

This is a small example app/intro to Shiny in R, using our data. Given a user-selected camera serial number, we show a bar chart of the animals that this camera has seen. Note that this is not one of the items as requested by CI; rather, it serves as an intro to our data and to Shiny.

To use this app, please populate the `/data` folder as it is in Google drive and make your local directory match the structure indicated in the project README file. Directions to run the app can be found [here](http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/running.html).
